1, Wordle is a simple single player game in which you are tasked with guessing a 5 letter word in 6 or less guesses. your guesses must be words (not random letters e.g. abhdu). once you submit your guess the letters squares will change colour. either green indicateing a correct letter in the correct possitionn, yellow indicating a correct letter in the incorrect position, or grey meaning the letter is not in the word at all.


2, Type your guess with your keyboard and press enter. if nothing happens this means the word is not in the list. otherewise the letters will change colour depending on the word. once you guess a word correctly press enter again to reciev a new word. if you run out of guesses before correctly guessing the word the correct word will be displayed under "WORDLE" and you can press enter to reciev a new word.


3, There are currently 4 "cheat codes":  
&emsp; F1 - This will display the word you are trying to guess. If the word is already visible it will hide it.  
&emsp; F2 - This will change the word to guess into a different one in the list of your choesing. To do this simply type the word as if you where going to guess it but DO NOT press enter instead press F2. This will change the word to guess into the word you typed. (a good way to check this is with F1). If it has not worked it may be because your word is not in the word list, the current best way to check this is to see if it accepts your word as a guess.
&emsp; F3 - Resets the game board.  
&emsp; F4 - Resets the on screen keyboard.  
&emsp; NOTE - no other keys excluding *enter* will work when you correctly guess a word or run out of guesses until you press *enter*.
